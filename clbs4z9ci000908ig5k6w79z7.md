# Boost your Django skills: Learn how to use super()

The `super()` keyword is a useful tool in Django, a high-level Python web framework, for working with inheritance in classes. It allows a subclass to refer to its parent class, allowing the subclass to inherit attributes and methods from the parent class while also being able to override or extend them as needed.

Using `super()` can greatly simplify the process of working with inheritance in Django, allowing you to easily reuse code and customize your models, views, forms, and other components to fit your specific needs. In this article, we'll take a closer look at how to use the `super()` keyword in Django and explore some common use cases.

### **Inheriting attributes and methods in the** `__init__` method

One common use of `super()` in Django is in the `__init__` method of a subclass. This method is called when an instance of the subclass is created, and it is used to initialize the attributes of the instance.

For example, consider a Django model called `Product` with a subclass called `Book`. The `Product` model might have fields for a title and a price, while the `Book` model might have an additional field for the author. In the `__init__` method of the `Book` model, we can use `super()` to call the `__init__` method of the `Product` model and pass in the title and price fields, while also adding the `author` field specific to the `Book` model:

```python
class Product(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    price = models.DecimalField(decimal_places=2, max_digits=10)

class Book(Product):
    author = models.CharField(max_length=200)

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # additional procesing before saving
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
```

Using `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` in this way allows the `Book` model to inherit the `title` and `price` fields from the `Product` model, while also adding the `author` field specific to the `Book` model.

### **Overriding or extending methods in the subclass**

Another common use of `super()` in Django is in the `save` method of a model. This method is called when the model instance is saved to the database, and it is used to persist any updates to the model instance.

For example, consider a Django model called `Product` with a `save` method that updates a `last_modified` field every time the model is saved. A subclass of `Product` called `Book` might want to override the `save` method to do some additional processing before saving the model. In this case, the `save` method of the `Book` model could use `super()` to call the `save` method of the `Product` model and pass in any additional arguments, while also doing the additional

```python
class Product(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    price = models.DecimalField(decimal_places=2, max_digits=10)
    last_modified = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.last_modified = timezone.now()
        self.save()

class Book(Product):
    author = models.CharField(max_length=200)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Do additional processing here
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
```

In this revised version of the example code, the `save` method of the `Product` model saves the model instance after updating the `last_modified` field. When the `save` method of the `Book` model is called, it uses `super().save(*args, **kwargs)` to call the `save` method of the `Product` model, which saves the model instance with the updated `last_modified` field.

### **Using** `super()` in a Django serializer

In Django, serializers are used to convert Django models or querysets into JSON format, allowing you to easily send data over the web or store it in a database. Serializers are typically used in combination with Django views and Django Rest Framework, a powerful toolkit for building APIs in Django.

You can use `super()` in a Django serializer to easily inherit attributes and methods from a parent serializer and customize or extend them as needed. For example, consider a Django serializer called `ProductSerializer` with a subclass called `BookSerializer`. The `ProductSerializer` might have fields for a `title` and a `price`, while the `BookSerializer` might have an additional field for the `author`. In the `BookSerializer`, we can use `super()` to call the `ProductSerializer` and pass in the `title` and `price` fields, while also adding the `author` field specific to the `BookSerializer.`

### **Using** `super()` in Django template views

Django template views are used to render HTML templates and pass data to them for display. You can use `super()` in a Django template view to easily inherit attributes and methods from a parent template view and customize or extend them as needed.

One common use of `super()` in Django template views is in the `get_context_data` method, which is used to pass data to the template for rendering. For example, consider a Django template view called `ProductView` with a subclass called `BookView`. The `ProductView` might have a `title` variable, while the `BookView` might want to add an additional `author` variable. In the `BookView`, we can use `super()` to call the `get_context_data` method of the `ProductView` and pass in the `title` variable, while also adding the `author` variable specific to the `BookView`:

```python
class ProductView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'product.html'

    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
        context['title'] = 'Product'
        return context

class BookView(ProductView):
    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
        context['author'] = 'John Doe'
        return context
```

Using `super().get_context_data(**kwargs)` in this way allows the `BookView` to inherit the `title` variable from the `ProductView.`

### **Using** `super()` in Django forms

Django forms are used to validate and process user input. You can use `super()` in a Django form to easily inherit attributes and methods from a parent form and customize or extend them as needed.

One common use of `super()` in Django forms is in the `validate` method, which is used to perform validation on the form data. For example, consider a Django form called `ProductForm` with a subclass called `BookForm`. The `ProductForm` might have a field for a `title`, while the `BookForm` might want to add an additional `author` field and validate that the `author` field is not empty. In the `BookForm`, we can use `super()` to call the `validate` method of the `ProductForm` and pass in the `cleaned_data` dictionary, while also performing the additional validation for the `BookForm`:

```python
class ProductForm(forms.Form):
    title = forms.CharField(max_length=200)

    def validate(self):
        cleaned_data = super().validate()
        title = cleaned_data.get('title')
        # Validate the title field
        if not title:
            raise forms.ValidationError('Please enter a title.')
        return cleaned_data

class BookForm(ProductForm):
    author = forms.CharField(max_length=200)

    def validate(self):
        cleaned_data = super().validate()
        author = cleaned_data.get('author')
        # Validate the author field
        if not author:
            raise forms.ValidationError('Please enter an author.')
        return cleaned_data
```

Using `super().validate()` in this way allows the `BookForm` to inherit the validation for the `title` field from the `ProductForm`, while also performing additional validation for the `author` field specific to the `BookForm`.

### **Conclusion**

The `super()` keyword is a useful tool in Django for working with inheritance in classes. It allows a subclass to easily inherit attributes and methods from a parent class and customize or extend them as needed. Whether you're working with models, views, forms, or other components, `super()` can greatly simplify the process of working with inheritance in Django.
